## About this syllabus

The course will teach you how to develop deep learning models using  Pytorch. The course will start with Pytorch's  tensors and Automatic differentiation package. Then each section will cover different models starting off with fundamentals such as Linear Regression, and logistic/softmax regression. Followed by  Feedforward deep neural networks, the role of different activation functions, normalization and dropout layers. Then Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning will be covered. Finally, several other Deep learning methods will be covered.

Learning Outcomes:
After completing this course, learners will be able to:
•	explain and apply their knowledge of Deep Neural Networks and related machine learning methods
•	know how to use Python libraries such as PyTorch  for Deep Learning applications 
•	build Deep Neural Networks using PyTorch

If you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge upon successful completion of the course.
