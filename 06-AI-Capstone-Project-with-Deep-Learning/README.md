## About this syllabus

In this capstone, learners will apply their deep learning knowledge and expertise to a real world challenge.  They will use a library of their choice to develop and test a deep learning model. They will load and pre-process data for a real problem, build the model and validate it. Learners  will then present a project report to demonstrate the validity of their model and their proficiency in the field of Deep Learning.

Learning Outcomes:
After completing this course, learners will be able to:

- determine what kind of deep learning method to use in which situation
-	know how to build a deep learning model to solve a real problem 
-	master the process of creating  a deep learning pipeline 
-	apply knowledge of deep learning to improve models using real data
-	demonstrate ability to present and communicate outcomes of deep learning projects

If you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge upon successful completion of the course.
